Art Institute Recommendations Engine
====================================

Based on students' self-reported interests and available programs, this project provided recommendations for similar programs to students who were not accepted to the Art Institute's 24-hour design competition.

Future goals for the project: Create a more general program based on it where organizations can feed their participants' info and information about similar community programs into a google form, then receive recommendations for student opportunities.
